Distributed Key-Value Storage built on top of Scala/Akka

This project is a result of my owm implementation of 
different algorithms dedicated for distributed databases such as like:
- consistent hashing
- merkles tree
- vector clocks (records versioning)
- hintent handoff (failured detection)
- replication/partition mechanism

and so on...

Maybe some day this will be working solution. Stay tuned!
