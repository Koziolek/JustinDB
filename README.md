Distributed Key-Value Storage built on top of Scala/Akka

This project is a result of my own implementation of 
different algorithms dedicated for distributed databases such as like:
- consistent hashing
- data synchronization (Merkle Trees)
- records versioning (Vector Clocks)
- failured detection (Hinted Handoff)
- replication/partition mechanisms
and so on...

Maybe some day this will be working solution. 

PS: Stay tuned!
