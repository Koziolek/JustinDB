# JustinDB

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/speedcom/JustinDB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/speedcom/JustinDB)

Distributed Key-Value Storage built on top of Scala/Akka

This project is a result of my own implementation of
different algorithms dedicated for distributed databases such as:
- partitioning (Consistent Hashing)
- replication
- data synchronization (Merkle Trees)
- records versioning (Vector Clocks)
- failured detection (Hinted Handoff)
and so on...

PS: Stay tuned!
